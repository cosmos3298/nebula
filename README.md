My project is about making a template for Cognitive Experiments such as a simple target search task in Unity. An experiment built in Unity provides the potential to conduct experiments using a head-mounted display. Since I don't have no experience in Unity and its scripting languages(C# & Javascript), I have to do it from ground up and I chose C#.

The codes I wrote were in the folder, "Assets", and they have the ".cs" filename extension.
Since I'm still things about github, I simply uploaded all the files from Unity's project folder, which made things look messy.
I'll find a better way to manage things.
